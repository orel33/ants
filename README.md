# Ant Colony Simulation #

This is a simple *Ant Colony Simulation* game written in Python 3, based on the *PyGame* library. It is largely inspired by previous work of Fabrice Rossi.

## Download & Install ##

First clone the project available on GitHUB under GPL:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/orel33/ants
```

To install Python (root privilege required):

```
  $ sudo apt get install python3 pip3
```

To install the *PyGame* library (user privilege enough):

```
  $ pip3 install pygame
```

To start the game:

```
  $ python3 ./main.py
```

## Known Bugs ##

There is a [known bug](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/331) in the *pygame.mixer* module, which causes high CPU usage, when calling *pygame.init()*. A workaround is to disable the mixer module, *pygame.mixer.quit()* or not to enable it, by using *pygame.display.init()* and *pygame.font.init()* instead. Consequently, there is no music, no sound :-(
